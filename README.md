The [census Block Group](https://github.com/degauss-org/census_block_group) DeGAUSS container can be used to obtain census geography identifiers in order to merge in any of the data below or other extant data indexed by census geography identifiers.

Other [DeGAUSS images](https://degauss.org) are [available](https://degauss.org/available_images) that leverage exact location, rather than census-based geography identifiers to assess geomarkers.
